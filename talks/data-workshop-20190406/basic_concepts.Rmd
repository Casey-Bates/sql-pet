# Architecture

## Outline
* R
* RStudio
* Docker
* PostgreSQL
* R and Docker

## Tools we will use

![R and Docker](../../screenshots/environment_overview.png)

## Using a SQL database from R

Focus is R code accessing data in a SQL database

* Use RStudio to facilitate:
    * R development
    * Browsing the database
* Use Docker to simplify:
    * Installating PostgreSQL
    * Managing PostgreSQL (starting, stopping, re-initializing, ...)
* Most of this R code does _not_ depend on:
    * Location of database
    * Native installation vs Docker installation for the database
* So this R code generalizes to:
    * Native installation of RDBMS, rather than Docker
    * Other RDBMSs

## R
We assume a general familiarity with:

* R
* RStudio
* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)
    * [tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/v059/i10)
    * pipe operator (`%>%`)
    * `dplyr`
    * [techniques for tidying data](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

## RStudio

Using R code, we will:

* Docker
    * Set up a Docker image with PostgreSQL
    * Launch PostgreSQL inside a Docker container
* PostgreSQL
    * Write `dplyr` commands that operate on a PostgreSQL database
    * Write `DBI` commands that send SQL queries directly to a PostgreSQL database

## Connecting to a database

![Rstudio's DBMS architecture - slide # 33](../../screenshots/rstudioconf-2019-big-data-architecture.png)

## Accessing a relational database

* [`dplyr`](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) library
    * `inner_join`, `left_join`, ...
    * Generates [SQL-92 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92) code
* [`DBI` library](http://r-dbi.github.io/DBI/)
    * `dbExecute`, `dbGetQuery`, ...
    * Accepts embedded native `SQL` code
    * Specific language features of your DBMS
* Dependencies
    * [RPostgres](https://github.com/tomoakin/RPostgreSQL)
        * PostgreSQL driver for R

## Tidy data

_To Do_

Tidy data [@Wickham2014] is:

Well-behaved from the point of view of analysis and tools in the Tidyverse [@RStudio2019].  Tidy data is easier to think about and it is usually worthwhile to make the data tidy [@Wickham2018].  Tidy data is roughly equivalent to _third normal form_ as discussed below.

## Design of "normal data"

_To Do_

Data in a database is most often optimized to minimize storage space and increase performance while preserving integrity when adding, changing, or deleting data.  The Wikipedia article on  Database Normalization has a good introduction to the characteristics of "normal" data and the process of re-organizing it to meet those desirable criteria [@Wikipedia2019].  The bottom line is that "data normalization is practical" although there are mathematical arguments for normalization based on the preservation of data integrity.
