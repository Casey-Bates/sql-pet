# Getting Set Up

## Prerequisites

* R 3.4.0 or later
* RStudio (Preview) 1.2.1335 or later
* Docker Community Edition (18.09 or later)

## Optional
* Git for version control
* pgAdmin4 for PostgreSQL database administration

## Windows requirments
* 64-bit Intel / AMD processor with virtualization hardware enabled
* Windows 10 Pro with Hyper-V virtualizer enabled
* Docker for Windows
* 4 GB of RAM or greater

## Linux requirements
* 64-bit Intel / AMD processor with virtualization hardware enabled
* Docker CE supported distro
    - Fedora 29
    - Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS "Bionic Beaver"
    - Arch Linux
* Docker Community Edition (use Arch `docker` package on Arch)
* 4 GB of RAM or greater

## The `sqlpetr` R package
* To capture common functionality and minimize the amount of typing one has to do, we've created an R package called [`sqlpetr`](https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr/index.html).
* To install the package from the R console:

    ```
    install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("smithjd/sqlpetr", force = TRUE, 
                            build = FALSE, quiet = TRUE)
    ```

# Docker Concepts

## Images
* A _Docker image_ is the basic artifact of Docker.
* An image usually contains "just enough Linux" to support a single service.
    - In this workshop, the image contains Debian GNU/Linux "stretch" and the PostgreSQL 10 relational database management service.

## Containers
* A _container_ is a collection of Linux processes running on a Linux host.
* The host manages these processes as a collection.
* There is _logical_ isolation - hence the term "container" - but there is little management overhead, because the processes running in the container are plain old Linux processes.
* In common usage, containers are considered ephemeral - "cattle, not pets".

## How do I get an image?
* It's a build or buy decision:
    - "Buy" - download an image from an image repository
    - "Build" - create a Dockerfile and do `docker build`.
* In this workshop, we are "buying" the base PostgreSQL image from <https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres>. And we are [building on top of it](https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr/articles/building-the-dvdrental-docker-image.html) with a Dockerfile to install the [`dvdrental` database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/).

## OK, I have an image - now what?
* You create a container by running an image in it.
* Typically, a single process in the container will offer a service by listening on a TCP port.
* For that service to be useful on the host, we _publish_ that port to `localhost`.
* In this workshop, we'll run the PostgreSQL image with the `dvdrental` database on it in a container and publish its port, *5439*, to `localhost`.
    - We use port 5439 rather than the default 5432. Why? If PostgreSQL is running on the host or in another container, it probably has claimed port 5432, since that's its default, and our container won't work! So we need to use a different port for our PostgreSQL container.

# PostgreSQL Database Administration 101

## Clusters, databases, schemas and views
* A PostgreSQL server is called a _cluster_. A cluster of what? Databases!
* A PostgreSQL _database_ is a collection of _schemas_. 
* Every PostgreSQL database has at least one default schema, called `public`.
* A _schema_ is a collection of objects. 
    - Usually these are _tables_, but there are other types.
    - The `dvdrental` database has tables and views.
    - A _view_ is a query - when you reference it, PostgreSQL runs the query and returns its results as if it were a table.

## Users / Roles
* PostgreSQL users and groups of users are called _roles_.
* PostgreSQL has a very fine-grained permission system for which roles can perform which operations on which objects.
* There is at least one database superuser, `postgres`, that can do anything to any object.
    - `postgres` can create and drop databases, schemas, tables, views.
    - `postgres` can create and drop roles and _GRANT_ or _REVOKE_ their privileges.
* For this workshop, you are going to be `postgres`, the database superuser.
* In the real world, there will be a DBA who does that and GRANTs you exactly what you need to do your job.
    
## Making a connection
* To use a PostgreSQL service, you need to open a _connection_.
* A connection needs five things:

    1. The _host_ where the service is running,
    2. The _port_ where the service is listening,
    3. The _database_ you want to connect to,
    4. The _user_ you want to connect as, and
    5. That user's _password_.
* In the workshop, `host` will be "localhost", `port` will be 5439, `database` will be "dvdrental", and both `user` and `password` will be "postgres". 

# Testing the Setup

## Building the image
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(sqlpetr)
sp_check_that_docker_is_up()
sp_make_dvdrental_image("postgres-dvdrental")
sp_docker_images_tibble()

```

## Running the container
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sp_pg_docker_run(
  container_name = "sql-pet",
  image_tag = "postgres-dvdrental",
  postgres_password = "postgres"
)
sp_docker_containers_tibble()

```
## Opening a connection
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
con <- sp_get_postgres_connection(
  host = "localhost",
  port = 5439,
  user = "postgres",
  password = "postgres",
  dbname = "dvdrental",
  seconds_to_test = 30, connection_tab = TRUE
)

```
