## Get some basic information about your database

Assume that the Docker container with PostgreSQL and the dvdrental database are ready to go.
Start up the `docker-pet` container:

```{r}
sp_docker_start("sql-pet")
```

Now connect to the `dvdrental` database with R.  

```{r}
con <- sp_get_postgres_connection(
  user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
  dbname = "dvdrental",
  seconds_to_test = 10
)
```

## Communicating with Docker Applications

One assumption we made is that most users use `RStudio` to interface with `R`. The four take aways from the diagram above are labeled:

### dbConnect

R-SQL processing, the purpose of this tutorial, is performed via a database connection. This should be a simple task, but often turns out to take a lot of time to actually get it to work.  We assume that your final write ups are done in some flavor of an Rmd document and others will have access to the database to confirm or further your analysis.

One focus of this tutorial is SQL processing through a dbConnection and we will come back to this in a future section.  The remainder of this section focuses on some specific Docker commands. 
                     
### bash

The Docker container runs on top of a small Linux kernel foot print.  Since Mac and Linux users run a version of Linux already, they may want to poke around the Docker environment directly from the bash command line interface (CLI).  Below is the CLI command to start up a bash session, execute a version of hello world, and exit the `bash` session.

(In this and subsequent example, an initial `$` represents your system prompt, which varies according to operating system and local environment.)

In your computer's command prompt:

  `$ docker exec -ti sql-pet bash`

Inside the `bash` (UNIX command) environment:
```

$ echo "'hello world'" talking to you live from a bash shell session within Docker!

'hello world' talking to you live from a bash shell session within Docker!
$ exit
```
Now back at your computer command prompt with:

  `$ exit`

Note that the user in the example is root.  Root has all priviledges and can destroy the Docker environment.  

### psql

For users comfortable executing SQL from a command line directly against the database, can run the `psql` application directly.  Below is the CLI command to start up `psql` session, execute a version of hello world, and quitting the `psql` version.

In your computer's command prompt:

   `$ docker exec -ti sql-pet psql -a -p 5432 -d dvdrental -U postgres`

That executes a postreSQL program in docker called `psql`, which is a command line interface to postgreSQL.  `psql` responds with:

```
psql (10.5 (Debian 10.5-1.pgdg90+1))
Type "help" for help.
```
You enter:

    `select '"hello world" talking to you live from postgres inside Docker!' hello;`

All SQL commands need to end with a semi-colon. `psql` responds with:

```
                                hello
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 "hello world" talking to you live from postgres inside Docker!
(1 row)
```

* To explore the PostgreSQL environment it's worth browsing around inside the Docker command with a shell.

  + To run the Docker container that contains PostgreSQL, you can enter this from a command prompt:

    `$ docker exec -ti pet sh`

  + To exit Docker enter:

    `# exit`

  + Inside Docker, you can enter the PostgreSQL command-line utility psql by entering 

    `# psql -U postgres`

    Handy [psql commands](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/gs/43/pdf/PSQLQuickRef.pdf) include:

    + `postgres=# \h`          # psql help
    + `postgres=# \dt`         # list PostgreSQL tables
    + `postgres=# \c dbname`   # connect to databse dbname
    + `postgres=# \l`          # list PostgreSQL databases
    + `postgres=# \conninfo`   # display information about current connection
    + `postgres=# \q`          # exit psql


To exit `psql`, enter:
```
    \q
```

The docker bash and psql command options are optional for this tutorial, but open up a gateway to some very powerful programming techniques for future exploration.

### start-stop

Docker has about 44 commands.  We are interested in only those related to Postgres status, started, stopped, and available.  In this tutorial, complete docker commands are printed out before being executed via a `system2` call.  In the event that a code block fails, one can copy and paste the docker command into your local CLI and see if Docker is returning additional information.

## command structure

We use two trivial commands to explore the various *interfaces*.  `ls -l` is the unix command for listing information about a file and `\du` is the psql command to list the users that exist in postgreSQL.

Your OS and the OS inside docker may be looking at the same file but they are in different time zones.

### Get info on a local file from R code

```{r}
file.info("README.md")

# Or, using the system2 command:

system2("ls",  "-l README.md", stdout = TRUE, stderr = FALSE)
```

### Get info on the same OS file inside Docker from R Code

```{r}
system2("docker", "exec sql-pet ls -l petdir/README.md", stdout = TRUE, stderr = FALSE)
```

### List postgreSQL users from Rstudio terminal (simulated)

We can't show exactly what a terminal session looks like in this R Markdown book, so we resort to representing it indirectly.

To get a unix command line *inside the sql-pet Docker environment*, enter this command:

> `$ docker exec -it sql-pet bash`

The `$` represents the unix command prompt in your R Studio terminal session.  The unix command prompt inside Docker in this case is `root@ce265d6e5361:/#`.  A trivial Unix command to get the date therefore is: 

> `root@ce265d6e5361:/# date`
>
> `Fri Nov 30 00:29:04 UTC 2018`
 
From that unix command prompt you can also enter the `psql` app (which has sit's own command line interface).  Execute the postgreSQL comand line program `psql`, logging on as `postgres`, and show a list of users:

> `root@ce265d6e5361:/# psql -U postgres -c '\du'`
`psql` returns:

> 
>                                    List of roles
>  `Role name` |                         `Attributes`                         | `Member of`
> -----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
>  `postgres`  | `Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS` | `{}`

To exit unix inside the Docker container, enter `exit`:

> `root@ce265d6e5361:/# exit`
> 
> `exit`
> 
We are then back to the R Studio terminal command:

> `$`
>


### List postgreSQL users from R code
```{r}
system2("docker", "exec sql-pet psql -U postgres -c '\\du' ", 
        stdout = TRUE, stderr = FALSE)
```

## Exercises

Docker containers have a small foot print.  In our container, we are running a limited Linux kernel and a Postgres database.  To show how tiny the docker environment is, we will look at all the processes running inside Docker and the top level file structure.

### Docker Help

Typing `docker` at the command line will print up a summary of all available `docker` commands.  Below are the docker commands used in the exercises.

    Commands:
      ps          List containers
      start       Start one or more stopped containers
      stop        Stop one or more running containers

The general format for a Docker command is 

    docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND ARGUMENTS
    
Below is the output for the Docker exec help command which was used in the `bash` and `psql` command examples above and for an exercise below.

```
$ docker help exec

Usage:  docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]

Run a command in a running container

Options:
  -d, --detach               Detached mode: run command in the background
      --detach-keys string   Override the key sequence for detaching a
                             container
  -e, --env list             Set environment variables
  -i, --interactive          Keep STDIN open even if not attached
      --privileged           Give extended privileges to the command
  -t, --tty                  Allocate a pseudo-TTY
  -u, --user string          Username or UID (format:
                             <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
  -w, --workdir string       Working directory inside the container
```
In the following exercies, use the `-i` option and the CONTAINER = `sql-pet`.

Start up R/RStudio and convert the CLI command to an R/RStudio command
