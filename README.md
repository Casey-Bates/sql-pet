## Project organization

* Meeting agenda items go here: https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet/projects/1
* Kanban is here: https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet/projects/2 
* Slack: [self-invite is here](http://pdxdata.org/slack/)

## Book

* Tutorial materials from this repo go in the online book, "[R, Databases and Docker](https://smithjd.github.io/sql-pet/)".
* Each chapter is written so it can be executed independently (once the Docker container is built in Chapter 5). We are using a [Knit-then-Merge](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/new-session.html) approach, so each chapter of the book can be Knitted separately.  
* The book depends on the `sqlrpetr` package.  It can be downloaded using `devtools::install_github("smithjd/sqlpetr")`

## Prerequisites
You will need:

* A computer running 
  + Windows (Windows 7 64-bit or late - Windows 10-Pro is recommended)
  + macOS
  + Linux (any Linux distro that will run [Docker Community Edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community), [R](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/), and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) will work)
* Current versions of [R and RStudio](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## How to contribute
If you'd like to contribute to this project, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet/pulls) to see whether someone else has already raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this project, do one of the following:

* If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* If your contribution is major, such as a new learning module or a significant restructuring of current code and training material, start by opening an issue first. That way, before you do any work, other people can weigh in on the discussion to make sure that your goals are aligned with the direction of the project.

We provide more guidelines for coding style and developer's workflow in the [Contributing](https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet/blob/master/Contributing.md) document. The [project wiki](https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet/wiki) is also a good source of information for developers.

To compile the book, you need to additionally [install webshot](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html-widgets.html) so that HTMLwidgets are displayed properly:

```
   install.packages("webshot")
   webshot::install_phantomjs()
```
