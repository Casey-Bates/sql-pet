The SQL block uses a nested SQL block.  The inner block is the same SQL used in the previous SQL code block.

A subquery is a SELECT statement nested within another SELECT statement.  In the example below, the nested SQL block follows the `from` and enclosed in parenthesis.  The nested subquery is aliased as `ctry`.  The subquery returns intermediate results, country counts.

<p>From the previous exercise we know that the top two films are <code>Bucket Brotherhood</code> and <code>Rocketeer Mother</code>. To answer this question we look at the <code>rental</code>, <code>inventory</code>, and <code>film</code> tables again. Instead of looking at the film level, we need to drill down to the individual dvd’s for each film to answer this question.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">18.2.20</span> 20. Which customers have never rented a movie?</h3>
<p>To answer this question we look at the <code>customer</code> and <code>rental</code> tables.</p>
<!--
Businesses spend a lot of time and money converting prospects to customers.  The manager would like you to generate a list of customers who have never rented a movie.

This type of question is what dplyr calls an anti-join.  SQL doesn't have a formal anti-join, but an anti-join can be implemented in multiple ways in SQL.  In this case, the anti-join returns customer rows from a left outer join from customer to the rental table with a null rental_id.  In the next three code blocks, we show three different ways to implement an Anti-Join

#### SQL ANTI JOIN -- Null Syntax

<p>Parmeterize the previous exercise to show the top 5 and bottom 5 customers.</p>
<!--

The issue with the two previous reports is that the top end is hardcoded.  Over time, the current customers will always be in the top section and new customers will get added.  Another way of looking at the previous report is to show the top 5 and bottom 5 customers.  

The managers would like to send a special promotion to the top n1 customers and exclude the bottom n2 customer from any new promotions.

### Inline SQL Block Syntax

An Inline SQL Block is an inner SQL statement that acts like a table within an outer SQL select statement.  The inner SQL select statement is enclosed in parens, () and aliased, TBL1 and TBL2 in the following examples.  


```
Form 1:
SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT * FROM A,B,C ...) AS TBL1
      ,(SELECT * FROM X,Y,Z ...) AS TBL2
 WHERE TBL1.COL_E = TBL2.COL_E ... 

Form 2:
SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT
          FROM (SELECT *
                  FROM A,B,C ...          
               ) AS TBL1
       ) AS TBL2
```

### Active SQL Analysis

In this code block summarize the activebool and active value combinations as a count of the two values combinations, a percent, and a running total.


```r
active_sql <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select c.activebool
         ,c.active,count(*), round(100 * count(*)/sum(count(*)) over (),2) as pct
         ,sum(count(*)) over (order by activebool, active) running_total
     from customer c
   group by c.activebool,c.active
  "
)
sp_print_df(active_sql)
```

<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1115ac20b1934dc03eff">{"x":{"filter":"none","data":[["1","2"],[true,true],[0,1],[15,589],[2.48,97.52],[15,604]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>activebool<\/th>\n      <th>active<\/th>\n      <th>count<\/th>\n      <th>pct<\/th>\n      <th>running_total<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[2,3,4,5]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

The `activebool` column only takes on a single value, `true`.  The `active` column takes on only two values, {0,1}.  

Dplyr order_by

```
Description

This function makes it possible to control the ordering of window functions in R that don't have a specific ordering parameter. When translated to SQL it will modify the order clause of the OVER function.

Usage

order_by(order_by, call)
Arguments

order_by    
a vector to order_by
call    
a function call to a window function, where the first argument is the vector being operated on
```

??? how to implement multi-column order by in example below???  If there were more than two combinations, I would like to see it ordered by all combinations


```r
customer_table <- DBI::dbReadTable(con, "customer")
active_dplyr <- customer_table %>% group_by(activebool,active) %>% 
    summarize(cnt=n()) %>% 
    mutate(running=order_by(active,cumsum(cnt))
          ,total=sum(cnt)
          ,pct=round(100 * cnt/total,2)
          ) %>%
select(-running)    
sp_print_df(active_dplyr)
```

### 12.  DVD rental distribution Running Totals.

In exercise 'What Countries Constitute the Top 25% of the Customer Base?' you had a running total and running percent for each country.  Use the preceding exercise and add a running total by film-dvd within a store, film-dvd across stores, and a running total for each dvd.  To make validation easy, restrict the query to the top two DVD rentals.


```r
film_rank_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
