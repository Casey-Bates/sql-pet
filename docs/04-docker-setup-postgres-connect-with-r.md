# Docker, Postgres, and R (04)

> This chapter demonstrates how to:
>
>  * Run, clean-up and close postgreSQL in docker containers.
>  * Keep necessary credentials secret while being available to R when it executes.
>  * Interact with PostgreSQL when it's running inside a Docker container.
>  * Read and write to PostgreSQL from R.

The following packages are used in this chapter:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres)
require(knitr)
library(sqlpetr)
```

Please install the `sqlpetr` package if not already installed:

```r
library(devtools)
if (!require(sqlpetr)) devtools::install_github("smithjd/sqlpetr")
```
Note that when you install the package the first time, it will ask you to update the packages it uses and that can take some time.

## Verify that Docker is running

Docker commands can be run from a terminal (e.g., the Rstudio Terminal pane) or with a `system()` command.  We provide the necessary functions to start, stop Docker containers and do other busy work in the `sqlpetr` package.  As time permits and curiosity dictates, feel free to look at those functions to see how they work.

Check that docker is up and running:


```r
sp_check_that_docker_is_up()
```

```
## [1] "Docker is up but running no containers"
```

## Clean up if appropriate
Remove the `cattle` and `sql-pet` containers if they exists (e.g., from a prior experiments).  

```r
sp_docker_remove_container("cattle")
sp_docker_remove_container("sql-pet")
```

The convention we use in this book is to put docker commands in the `sqlpetr` package so that you can ignore them if you want.  However, the functions are set up so that you can easily see how to do things with Docker and modify if you want.

We name containers `cattle` for "throw-aways" and `pet` for ones we treasure and keep around.  :-)

```r
sp_make_simple_pg("cattle")
```

```
## [1] 0
```

Docker returns a long string of numbers.  If you are running this command for the first time, Docker downloads the PostgreSQL image, which takes a bit of time.

The following command shows that a container named `cattle` is running `postgres:10`.  `postgres` is waiting for a connection:

```r
sp_check_that_docker_is_up()
```

```
## [1] "Docker is up, running these containers:"                                                                                                       
## [2] "CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                  PORTS                    NAMES"   
## [3] "76e45b19262c        postgres:10         \"docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦\"   1 second ago        Up Less than a second   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   cattle"
```
## Connect, read and write to Postgres from R

### Pause for some security considerations

We use the following `sp_get_postgres_connection` function to connect to PostgreSQL.  It will keep trying to connect to PostgreSQL, even if the dbms is not ready.  PostgreSQL can take different amounts of time to come up and be ready to accept connections from R, depending on various factors depending on your computer and its configuration. ^[See details for Windows here:<br>   https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/3-3-r-startup.html#r-startup </br>https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/3-3-r-startup.html#renviron ]

> When we call `sp_get_postgres_connection` below we'll use environment variables that R obtains from reading the *.Renviron* file when R starts up.  This approach has two benefits: that file is not uploaded to GitHub. R looks for it in your default directory every time it loads.  To see whether you have already created that file, use the R Studio Files tab to look at your **home directory**:
>
![](screenshots/locate-renviron-file.png)
>
> That file should contain lines that **look like** the example below. Although in this example it contains the PostgreSQL <b>default values</b> for the username and password, they are obviously not secret.  But this approach demonstrates where you should put secrets that R needs while not risking accidental uploaded to GitHub or some other public location..

Open your `.Renviron` file with this command:

>
> `file.edit("~/.Renviron")`
>

Or you can execute [define_postgresql_params.R](define_postgresql_params.R) to create the file or you could copy / paste the following into your **.Renviron** file:
```
DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME=postgres
```
Once that file is created, restart R, and after that R reads it every time it comes up. 

### Connect with Postgres

Connect to the postgrSQL using the `sp_get_postgres_connection` function:

```r
con <- sp_get_postgres_connection(user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
                         password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
                         dbname = "postgres",
                         seconds_to_test = 10)
```
If you don't have an `.Rprofile` file that defines those passwords, you can just insert a string for the parameter, like:

  `user= 'whatever', password = 'whatever'`

Make sure that you can connect to the PostgreSQL database that you started earlier. If you have been executing the code from this tutorial, the database will not contain any tables yet:


```r
dbListTables(con)
```

```
## character(0)
```
<!--
The following needs to be expanded and explained -- it doesn't stand on its own as written.
### Alternative: put the database password in an environment file

The goal is to put the password in an untracked file that will **not** be committed in your source code repository. Your code can reference the name of the variable, but the value of that variable will not appear in open text in your source code.

We have chosen to call the file `dev_environment.csv` in the current working directory where you are executing this script. That file name appears in the `.gitignore` file, so that you will not accidentally commit it. We are going to create that file now.

You will be prompted for the database password. By default, a PostgreSQL database defines a database user named `postgres`, whose password is `postgres`. If you have changed the password or created a new user with a different password, then enter those new values when prompted. Otherwise, enter `postgres` and `postgres` at the two prompts.

In an interactive environment, you could execute a snippet of code that prompts the user for their username and password with the following snippet (which isn't run in the book):

Your password is still in plain text in the file, `dev_environment.csv`, so you should protect that file from exposure. However, you do not need to worry about committing that file accidentally to your git repository, because the name of the file appears in the `.gitignore` file.

For security, we use values from the `environment_variables` data.frame, rather than keeping the `username` and `password` in plain text in a source file.

### Interact with Postgres

Write `mtcars` to PostgreSQL

```r
dbWriteTable(con, "mtcars", mtcars, overwrite = TRUE)
```

List the tables in the PostgreSQL database to show that `mtcars` is now there:


```r
dbListTables(con)
```

```
## [1] "mtcars"
```

```r
# list the fields in mtcars:
dbListFields(con, "mtcars")
```

```
##  [1] "mpg"  "cyl"  "disp" "hp"   "drat" "wt"   "qsec" "vs"   "am"   "gear"
## [11] "carb"
```

Download the table from the DBMS to a local data frame:

```r
mtcars_df <- tbl(con, "mtcars")

# Show a few rows:
knitr::kable(head(mtcars_df))
```



  mpg   cyl   disp    hp   drat      wt    qsec   vs   am   gear   carb

 21.4     6    258   110   3.08   3.215   19.44    1    0      3      1
 18.7     8    360   175   3.15   3.440   17.02    0    0      3      2

## Clean up

Afterwards, always disconnect from the dbms:

```r
dbDisconnect(con)
```
Tell Docker to stop the `cattle` container:

```r
sp_docker_stop("cattle")
```

Tell Docker to remove the `cattle` container from it's library of active containers:

```r
sp_docker_remove_container("cattle")
```

If we just **stop** the docker container but don't remove it (as we did with the `sp_docker_remove_container("cattle")` command), the `cattle` container will persist and we can start it up again later with `sp_docker_start("cattle")`.  In that case, `mtcars` would still be there and we could retrieve it from postgreSQL again.  Since `sp_docker_remove_container("cattle")`  has removed it, the updated database has been deleted.  (There are enough copies of `mtcars` in the world, so no great loss.)
