# Introduction to interacting with Postgres from R (10)


Note that `tidyverse`, `DBI`, `RPostgres`, `glue`, and `knitr` are loaded.  Also, we've sourced the `[db-login-batch-code.R]('r-database-docker/book-src/db-login-batch-code.R')` file which is used to log in to PostgreSQL.





## Basics

* keeping passwords secure
* Coverage in this book.  There are many SQL tutorials that are available.  For example, we are drawing some materials from  [a tutorial we recommend](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/).  In particular, we will not replicate the lessons there, which you might want to complete.  Instead, we are showing strategies that are recommended for R users.  That will include some translations of queries that are discussed there.

## Ask yourself about what you are aiming for?

* differences between production and data warehouse environments
* learning to keep your DBAs happy
  + You are your own DBA in this simulation, so you can wreak havoc and learn from it, but you can learn to be DBA-friendly here.
  + in the end it's the subject-matter experts that understand your data, but you have to work with your DBAs first

## Get some basic information about your database

Assume that the Docker container with PostgreSQL and the dvdrental database are ready to go.

```r
system2("docker",  "start sql-pet", stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "sql-pet"
```

```r
con <- wait_for_postgres(user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
                         password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
                         dbname = "dvdrental",
                         seconds_to_test = 10)
```

You usually need to use both the available documentation for your [database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) and to be somewhat skeptical (e.g., empirical).  It's worth learning to interpret the symbols in an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model):

Depending on how skeptical you are about the documentation, you might want to get an overview of a database by pulling data from the database `information_schema`.  Here's a selection of useful information although you may want more (or less).  There is a lot to choose from [a vast list of metadata](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/infoschema-columns.html).  Note that information schemas are somewhat consistent across different DBMS' that you may encounter.


have we hidden "in_schema()" as in:

  `con %>% tbl(in_schema("aux", "df"))`
  

```r
table_schema_query  <- glue("SELECT ", 
  "table_name, column_name, data_type, ordinal_position, column_default, character_maximum_length", 
  " FROM information_schema.columns ", 
  "WHERE table_schema = 'public'")
 
  rental_meta_data  <- dbGetQuery(con, table_schema_query) 

glimpse(rental_meta_data)
```

```

```
Pull out some rough-and-ready but useful statistics about your database.  Since we are in SQL-land we talk about variables as `columns`.

Start with a list of tables names and a count of the number of columns that each one contains.

```r
rental_meta_data %>% count(table_name) %>% rename(number_of_columns = n) %>% as.data.frame()
```

```
##                    table_name number_of_columns
## 1                       actor                 4
## 2                  actor_info                 4
## 3                     address                 8
## 4                    category                 3
## 5                        city                 4
## 6                     country                 3
## 7                    customer                10
## 8               customer_list                 9
## 9                        film                13
## 10                 film_actor                 3
## 11              film_category                 3
## 12                  film_list                 8
## 13                  inventory                 4
## 14                   language                 3
## 15 nicer_but_slower_film_list                 8
## 16                    payment                 6
## 17                     rental                 7
## 18     sales_by_film_category                 2
## 19             sales_by_store                 3
## 20                      staff                11
## 21                 staff_list                 8
## 22                      store                 4
```

How many column names are shared across tables (or duplicated)?

```r
rental_meta_data %>% count(column_name, sort = TRUE) %>% filter(n > 1)
```

```
## # A tibble: 34 x 2
