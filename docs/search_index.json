The goal of the exercises is extracting useful or questionable insights from one or more tables. Each exercise has has some or all of the following parts. The question. The tables used to answer the question. A hidden SQL code block showing the desired output. Click the code button to see the SQL code. A table of derived values or renamed columns shown in the SQL block to facilitate replicating the desired dplyr solution. Abbreviated column names are used to squeeze in more columns into the answer to reduce scrolling across the screen. A replication section where you recreate the desired output using dplyr syntax. Most columns come directly out of the tables. Each replication code block has three commented function calls sp_tbl_descr(‘store’) –describes a table, store sp_tbl_pk_fk(‘table_name’) –shows a table’s primary and foreign keys sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) –shows table row counts. To keep the exercises concentrated on the joins, all derived dates drop their timestamp. SQL syntax: date_column::DATE Dplyr syntax: as.date(date_column) 16.1 Exercise Instructions Manually execute all the code blocks up-to the “SQL Union Exercise.” Most of the exercises can be performed in any order. There are function exercises that create a function followed by another code block to call the function in the previous exercise. Use the Show Document Outline, CTL-Shift-O, to navigate to the different exercises.

Each table is loaded into an R object named TableName_table, via a DBI::dbReadTable call. actor_table &lt;- DBI::dbReadTable(con,“actor”) source(here::here(&#39;book-src&#39;,&#39;dvdrental-table-declarations.R&#39;),echo=FALSE) The following code block deletes and inserts records into the different tables used in the exercises in this chpater. The techniques used in this code block are discussed in detail in the appendix, ??add link here.?? source(file=here(&#39;book-src/sql_pet_data.R&#39;),echo=FALSE) 16.3 Overview Exercise When joining many tables, it is helpful to have the number of rows from each table as an initial sanity check that the joins are returning a reasonable number of rows. 16.3.1 1. How many rows are in each table? table_rows_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery( con, &quot;select * from ( select &#39;actor&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from actor union select &#39;category&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from category union select &#39;film&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from film union select &#39;film_actor&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from film_actor union select &#39;film_category&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from film_category union select &#39;language&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from language union select &#39;inventory&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from inventory union select &#39;rental&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from rental union select &#39;payment&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from payment union select &#39;staff&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from staff union select &#39;customer&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from customer union select &#39;address&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from address union select &#39;city&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from city union select &#39;country&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from country union select &#39;store&#39; tbl_name,count(*) from store ) counts order by tbl_name ; &quot; ) sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) 16.3.1.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

How Many Active, Inactive, and Total Customers Does the DVD Rental Business Have? To answer this question we look at the customer table. In a previous chapter we observed that there are two columns, activebool and active. We consider active = 1 as active. customer_cnt_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot;SELECT sum(case when active = 1 then 1 else 0 end) active ,sum(case when active = 0 then 1 else 0 end) inactive ,count(*) total from customer &quot;) sp_print_df(customer_cnt_sql) Our DVD Rental business is international and operates in three countries, Canada, Austraila, and the United States. Each country has one store. The stores in Canada and Austrailia have one employee each. The store in the United States has no employees yet. The business has 604 international customers, 589 are active and 15 inactive. 16.4.3.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) customer_cnt_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(customer_cnt_dplyr) 16.4.4 4. How Many and What Percent of Customers Are From Each Country? To answer this question we look at the customer, address, city, and country tables. customers_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot;select c.active,country.country,count(*) count ,round(100 * count(*) / sum(count(*)) over(),4) as pct from customer c join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id join city on a.city_id = city.city_id join country on city.country_id = country.country_id group by c.active,country order by count(*) desc &quot;) sp_print_df(customers_sql) Based on the table above, the DVD Rental business has customers in 118 countries. The DVD Rental business cannot have many walk in customers. It may possibly use a mail order distribution model. For an international company, how are the different currencies converted to a standard currency? Looking at the ERD, there is no currency conversion rate. 16.4.4.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) customers_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(customers_dplyr) 16.4.5 5 What Countries Constitute the Top 25% of the Customer Base? Using the previous code, add two new columns. One column shows a running total and the second column shows a running percentage. Order the data by count then by country. To answer this question we look at the customer, address, city, and country tables again. country_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot;select active,country,count ,sum(count) over (order by count desc,country rows between unbounded preceding and current row) running_total , pct ,sum(pct) over (order by pct desc,country rows between unbounded preceding and current row) running_pct from (-- Start of inner SQL Block select c.active,country.country,count(*) count ,round(100 * count(*) / sum(count(*)) over(),4) as pct from customer c join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id join city on a.city_id = city.city_id join country on city.country_id = country.country_id group by c.active,country ) ctry -- End of inner SQL Block order by count desc,country &quot;) sp_print_df(country_sql) The top 25% of the customer base are from India, China, the United States, and Japan. The next six countries, the top 10, Mexico, Brazil, Russian Federation, Philipines, Indonesia, and Turkey round out the top 50% of the businesses customer base. 16.4.5.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) country_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(country_dplyr) 16.4.6 6. How many customers are in Australia and Canada? To answer this question we use the results from the previous exercise. country_au_ca_sql &lt;- country_sql %&gt;% filter(country == &#39;Australia&#39; | country == &#39;Canada&#39;) sp_print_df(country_au_ca_sql) There are 10 customers in Austrailia and Canada where the brick and mortar stores are located. The 20 customers are less than 2% of the world wide customer base. 16.4.6.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) country_au_ca_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(country_au_ca_dplyr) 16.4.7 7. How Many Languages? With an international customer base, how many languages does the DVD Rental business distribute DVD’s in. To answer this question we look at the language table. languages_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot; select * from language &quot;) sp_print_df(languages_sql) DVD’s are distributed in six languages. 16.4.7.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) # languages_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) # # sp_print_df(language_table) 16.4.8 8. What is the distribution of DVD’s by Language To answer this question we look at the language and film tables. language_distribution_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &#39; select l.language_id,name &quot;language&quot;,count(f.film_id) from language l left join film f on l.language_id = f.language_id group by l.language_id,name order by l.language_id &#39;) sp_print_df(language_distribution_sql) This is a surprise. For an international customer base, the entire stock of 1001 DVD’s are in English only. 16.4.8.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) language_distribution_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(language_distribution_dplyr) 16.4.9 9. What are the number of rentals and rented amount by store, by month? To answer this question we look at the rental, inventory, and film tables to answer this question. store_rentals_by_mth_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot;select * ,sum(rental_amt) over (order by yyyy_mm,store_id rows between unbounded preceding and current row) running_rental_amt from (select yyyy_mm,store_id,rentals,rental_amt ,sum(rentals) over(partition by yyyy_mm order by store_id) mo_rentals ,sum(rental_amt) over (partition by yyyy_mm order by store_id) mo_rental_amt from (select to_char(rental_date,&#39;yyyy-mm&#39;) yyyy_mm ,i.store_id,count(*) rentals, sum(f.rental_rate) rental_amt from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id group by to_char(rental_date,&#39;yyyy-mm&#39;),i.store_id ) as details ) as mo_running order by yyyy_mm,store_id &quot;) sp_print_df(store_rentals_by_mth_sql) The current entry, row 11, is our new rental row we added to show the different joins in a previous chapter. 16.4.9.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) store_rentals_by_mth_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(head(store_rentals_by_mth_dplyr, n=25)) 16.4.10 10. Rank Films Based on the Number of Times Rented and Associated Revenue To answer this question we look at the rental, inventory, and film tables. film_rank_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot;select f.film_id,f.title,f.rental_rate,count(*) count,f.rental_rate * count(*) rental_amt from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id group by f.film_id,f.title,f.rental_rate order by count(*) desc&quot;) sp_print_df(film_rank_sql) The most frequently rented movie, 34 times, is ‘Bucket Brotherhood’ followed by Rocketeer Mother, 33 times. 16.4.10.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) film_rank_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(film_rank_dplyr) 16.4.11 11 What is the rental distribution/DVD for the top two rented films? From the previous exercise we know that the top two films are Bucket Brotherhood and Rocketeer Mother. To answer this question we look at the rental, inventory, and film tables again. Instead of looking at the film level, we need to drill down to the individual dvd’s for each film to answer this question. film_rank2_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot;select i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id,count(*) from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id where i.film_id in (103,738) group by i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id&quot;) sp_print_df(film_rank2_sql) The ‘Bucket Brotherhood’ and ‘Rocketeer Mother’ DVD’s are equally distributed between the two stores, 4 dvd’s each per film. The ‘Bucket Brotherhood’ was rented 17 times from both stores. The ‘Rocketeer Mother’ was rented 15 times from store 1 and 18 times from store 2. 16.4.11.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) film_rank2_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(film_rank2_dplyr) 16.4.12 12. List staffing information for store 1 associated with the Bucket Brother rentals? To answer this question we look at the rental, inventory, film, staff, address, city, and country tables. film_103_details_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot;select i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id inv_id,i.store_id inv_store_id ,r.rental_date::date rented,r.return_date::date returned ,s.staff_id,s.store_id staff_store_id,concat(s.first_name,&#39; &#39;,s.last_name) staff,ctry.country from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id join staff s on r.staff_id = s.staff_id join address a on s.address_id = a.address_id join city c on a.city_id = c.city_id join country ctry on c.country_id = ctry.country_id where i.film_id in (103) and r.rental_date::date between &#39;2005-05-01&#39;::date and &#39;2005-06-01&#39;::date order by r.rental_date &quot;) sp_print_df(film_103_details_sql) In a previous exercise we saw that store 1 based in Canada and store 2 based in Austrailia each had one employee, staff_id 1 and 2 respectively. We see that Mike from store 1, Canada, had transactions in store 1 and store 2 on 5/25/2005. Similarly Jon from store 2, Australia, had transaction in store 2 and store 1 on 5/31/2005. Is this phsically possible, or a key in error? 16.4.12.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. column mapping definition inv_id inventory.inventory_id inv_store_id inventory.store_id rented rental.rental_date returned rental.return_date staff_store_id store.store_id staff first_name+last_name # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) film_103_details_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(film_103_details_dplyr) 16.4.13 13. Which film(s) have never been rented To answer this question we look at the film, inventory and rental tables. never_rented_dvds_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &#39;select i.store_id,f.film_id, f.title,f.description, i.inventory_id from film f join inventory i on f.film_id = i.film_id left join rental r on i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id where r.inventory_id is null &#39; ) sp_print_df(never_rented_dvds_sql) There are only two movies that have not been rented, Academy Dinousaur and Sophie’s Choice. 16.4.13.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) never_rented_dvds_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(never_rented_dvds_dplyr) 16.4.14 14. How many films are in each film rating? To answer this question we look at the film table to answer this question. film_ratings_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &#39;select f.rating,count(*) from film f group by f.rating order by count(*) desc &#39; ) sp_print_df(film_ratings_sql) There are 5 ratings and all 5 have roughly 200 movies. 16.4.14.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) film_ratings_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(film_ratings_dplyr) 16.4.15 15.

How many DVD’s are in each film categeory? To answer this question we look at the category table again. film_categories2_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &#39;select c.name,count(*) count from category c join film_category fc on c.category_id = fc.category_id group by c.name order by count(*) desc &#39; ) sp_print_df(film_categories2_sql) There are 16 film categories. The highest category, Sports, has 77 films followed by the International category which has 76 film. What is an example of an international category film where all films are currently in English? 16.4.16.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) film_categories2_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(film_categories2_dplyr) 16.4.17 17. Which films are listed in multiple categories?

The top 3 customers have 10 DVD’s each that have not been paid. 16.4.30.1 Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax. column definition mapping customer first_name + last_name Pay_record Payment record exists Y/N case when p.amount is null then ‘No’ else ‘Yes’ end rental_amt aggrgated film.rental_rate paid_amt aggregated payment.amount due_amt aggregated film.rental_rate - payment.amount cnt number of rentals/customer rn row number # sp_tbl_descr(&#39;store&#39;) # sp_tbl_pk_fk(&#39;table_name&#39;) # sp_print_df(table_rows_sql) customer_open_amts_dplyr &lt;- as.data.frame(&quot;code me&quot;) sp_print_df(customer_open_amts_dplyr) 16.4.31 31. What is the business cash flow? In the previous exercise we saw that about 50% of the rentals collected the correct amount and 40% of the rentals over collected. The last 10% were never collected. Calculate the number of days it took before the payment was collected and the amount collected? To answer this question we look at the rental, customer, payment, inventory, payment and film tables to answer this question. cash_flow_sql &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot;SELECT payment_date - exp_rtn_dt payment_days ,sum(coalesce(amount, charges)) paid_or_due ,count(*) late_returns FROM ( SELECT payment_date::DATE ,(r.rental_date + INTERVAL &#39;1 day&#39; * f.rental_duration)::DATE exp_rtn_dt ,p.amount ,f.rental_rate charges ,r.rental_date ,r.return_date FROM rental r LEFT JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id LEFT JOIN address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id LEFT JOIN city ON city.city_id = a.city_id LEFT JOIN country ctry ON ctry.country_id = city.country_id LEFT JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id LEFT JOIN payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id AND p.rental_id = r.rental_id LEFT JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id WHERE return_date &gt; (r.rental_date + INTERVAL &#39;1 day&#39; * f.rental_duration)::DATE ) AS src GROUP BY payment_date - exp_rtn_dt ORDER BY payment_date - exp_rtn_dt DESC&quot;) sp_print_df(cash_flow_sql) Wow those are really generous terms.
