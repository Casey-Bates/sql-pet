Edward (Ed) Borasky, editor 2018-09-05 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Why integrate R with databases using Docker? Large data stores in organizations are stored in databases that have specific access constraints and structural characteristics. Learning to navigate the gap between R and the database is difficult to simulate outside corporate walls. R users frequently need to make sense of complex data structures using diagnostic techniques that shuld not be reinvented Docker is a relatively easy way to simulate the relationship between an R/Rstudio session and database – all on on a single machine. 1.2 Who are we? M. Edward (Ed) Borasky - @znmeb John David Smith - @smithjd Scott Came - @scottcame Ian Franz - @ianfrantz Sophie Yang - @SophieMYang Jim Tyhurst - @jimtyhurst 1.3 Prerequisites You will need A computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux. Any Linux distro that will run Docker Community Edition, R and RStudio will work, R, and Docker hosting.
