Edward (Ed) Borasky, editor 2018-09-12 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Using R to query a DBMS in your organization Large data stores in organizations are stored in databases that have specific access constraints and structural characteristics. Data documentation may be incomplete, often emphsizes operational issues rather than analytical ones, and often needs to be confirmed on the fly. Data volumes and query performance are important design constraints. R users frequently need to make sense of complex data structures and coding schemes to address incompletely formed questions so that exploratory data analysis has to be fast. Exploratory techniques for the purpose should not be reinvented (and so would benefit from more public instruction or discussion). Learning to navigate the interfaces (passwords, packages, etc.) between R and a database is difficult to simulate outside corporate walls. Resources for interface problem diagnosis behind corporate walls may or may not address all the issues that R users face, so a simulated environment is needed. 1.2 Docker’s role Noam Ross’s “Docker for the UseR” suggests that there are four distinct Docker use-cases for useRs. Make a fixed working environment for reproducible analysis Access a service outside of R (e.g., Postgres) Create an R based service (e.g., with plumber) Send our compute jobs to the cloud with minimal reconfiguration or revision This book explores #2 because it allows us to work on the database access issues described above and to practice on an industrial-scale DBMS. Docker is a relatively easy way to simulate the relationship between an R/Rstudio session and a database – all on on a single machine, provided you have Docker installed and running. You may want to run PostgresSQL on a Docker container, avoiding any OS or system dependencies that might come up. 1.3 Docker and R on your machine Here is how R and Docker fit on your operating system in this tutorial: (This diagram needs to be updated as our directory structure evolves.) 1.4 Who are we? M. Edward (Ed) Borasky - @znmeb John David Smith - @smithjd Scott Came - @scottcame Ian Franz - @ianfrantz Sophie Yang - @SophieMYang Jim Tyhurst - @jimtyhurst Paul Refalo - @paulrefalo 1.5 Prerequisites You will need A computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux (Any Linux distro that will run Docker Community Edition, R and RStudio will work), R, and Rstudio and Docker hosting. The database we use is PostgreSQL 10, but you do not need to install that - it’s installed via a Docker image. RStudio 1.2 is highly recommended but not required. 1.6 Install Docker Install Docker. Installation depends on your operating system: On a Mac On UNIX flavors For Windows, consider these issues and follow these instructions. 1.7 Download the repo First step: download this repo. It contains source code to build a Docker container that has the dvdrental database in Postgress and shows how to interact with the database from R. "],
["docker-hosting-for-windows.html", "Chapter 2 Docker Hosting for Windows 2.1 Hardware requirements 2.2 Software requirements 2.3 Docker for Windows settings 2.4 Git, GitHub and line endings", " Chapter 2 Docker Hosting for Windows Skip these instructions if your computer has either OSX or a Unix variant. 2.1 Hardware requirements You will need an Intel or AMD processor with 64-bit hardware and the hardware virtualization feature. Most machines you buy today will have that, but older ones may not. You will need to go into the BIOS / firmware and enable the virtualization feature. You will need at least 4 gigabytes of RAM! 2.2 Software requirements You will need Windows 7 64-bit or later. If you can afford it, I highly recommend upgrading to Windows 10 Pro. 2.2.1 Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 Home (64 bit) Install Docker Toolbox. The instructions are here: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/. Make sure you try the test cases and they work! 2.2.2 Windows 10 Pro Install Docker for Windows stable. The instructions are here: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#start-docker-for-windows. Again, make sure you try the test cases and they work. 2.3 Docker for Windows settings 2.3.1 Shared drives If you’re going to mount host files into container filesystems (as we do in the following chapters), you need to set up shared drives. Open the Docker settings dialog and select Shared Drives. Check the drives you want to share. In this screenshot, the D: drive is my 1 terabyte hard drive. 2.3.2 Kubernetes Kubernetes is a container orchestration / cloud management package that’s a major DevOps tool. It’s heavily supported by Red Hat and Google, and as a result is becoming a required skill for DevOps. However, it’s overkill for this project at the moment. So you should make sure it’s not enabled. Go to the Kubernetes dialog and make sure the Enable Kubernetes checkbox is cleared. 2.4 Git, GitHub and line endings Git was originally developed for Linux - in fact, it was created by Linus Torvalds to manage hundreds of different versions of the Linux kernel on different machines all around the world. As usage has grown, it’s achieved a huge following and is the version control system used by most large open source projects, including this one. If you’re on Windows, there are some things about Git and GitHub you need to watch. First of all, there are quite a few tools for running Git on Windows, but the RStudio default and recommended one is Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win). By default, text files on Linux end with a single linefeed (\\n) character. But on Windows, text files end with a carriage return and a line feed (\\r\\n). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline for the gory details. Git defaults to checking files out in the native mode. So if you’re on Linux, a text file will show up with the Linux convention, and if you’re on Windows, it will show up with the Windows convention. Most of the time this doesn’t cause any problems. But Docker containers usually run Linux, and if you have files from a repository on Windows that you’ve sent to the container, the container may malfunction or give weird results. This kind of situation has caused a lot of grief for contributors to this project, so beware. In particular, executable sh or bash scripts will fail in a Docker container if they have Windows line endings. You may see an error message with \\r in it, which means the shell saw the carriage return (\\r) and gave up. But often you’ll see no hint at all what the problem was. So you need a way to tell Git that some files need to be checked out with Linux line endings. See https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/ for the details. Summary: You’ll need a .gitattributes file in the root of the repository. In that file, all text files (scripts, program source, data, etc.) that are destined for a Docker container will need to have the designator &lt;spec&gt; text eol=lf, where &lt;spec&gt; is the file name specifier, for example, *.sh. This repo includes a sample: .gitattributes "],

Large data stores in organizations are stored in databases that have specific access constraints and structural characteristics. Learning to navigate the gap between R and the database is difficult to simulate outside corporate walls. R users frequently need to make sense of complex data structures using diagnostic techniques that shuld not be reinvented (and so would benefit from more public instruction and commentary). Docker is a relatively easy way to simulate the relationship between an R/Rstudio session and database – all on on a single machine. 3.2 Learning Goals After working through this tutorial, you can expect to be able to: Run queries against Postgres in an environment that simulates what you will find in a corporate setting. Understand some of the tradeoffs between queries aimed at exploration or informal investigation using dplyr and those where performance is important because of the size of the database or the frequency with which a query is run. You will be able to rewrite dplyr queries as SQL and submit them directly. You will have some understanding of techniques for assessing query structure and performance. Set up a Postgres database in a Docker enviornment and understand enough about Docker to swap databases, swap DBMS’ (e.g., MySQL for Postgres, etc.) 3.3 Use cases Imagine that you have one of several roles at DVDs R Us and that you need to: As a data scientist, I want to know the distribution of number of rentals per month per customer, so that the Marketing department can create incentives for customers in 3 segments: Frequent Renters, Average Renters, Infrequent Renters. As the Director of Sales, I want to see the total number of rentals per month for the past 6 months and I want to know how fast our customer base is growing/shrinking per month for the past 6 months. As the Director of Marketing, I want to know which categories of DVDs are the least popular, so that I can create a campaign to draw attention to rarely used inventory. As a shipping clerk, I want to add rental information when I fulfill a shipment order. As the Director of Analytics, you want to test as much of the production R code in my shop against a new release of the DBMS that the IT department is implementing next month. etc. 3.4 Environment This tutorial uses the Postgres version of “dvd rental” database, which can be downloaded here. Here’s a glimpse of it’s structure: Entity Relationship diagram for the dvdrental database "],

The first time it runs it will take a minute to create the Postgres environment. There are two important parts to this that may not be obvious: The source= paramter points to dvdrental.Dockerfile, which does most of the heavy lifting. It has detailed, line-by-line comments to explain what it is doing. Inside dvdrental.Dockerfile the comand COPY init-dvdrental.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ copies init-dvdrental.sh from the local file system into the specified location in the Docker container. When the Postgres Docker container initializes, it looks for that file and executes it. Doing all of that work behind the scenes involves two layers of complexity.

Use the downloader and here packages to keep track of things. if (!require(downloader)) install.packages(&quot;downloader&quot;) ## Loading required package: downloader if (!require(here)) install.packages(&quot;here&quot;) ## Loading required package: here ## here() starts at /Users/jds/Documents/Library/R/r-system/sql-pet/r-database-docker library(downloader, here) download(&quot;http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dvdrental.zip&quot;, destfile = here(&quot;dvdrental.zip&quot;)) unzip(here(&quot;dvdrental.zip&quot;), exdir = here()) # creates a tar archhive named &quot;dvdrental.tar&quot; file.remove(here(&quot;dvdrental.zip&quot;)) # the Zip file is no longer needed. ## [1] TRUE 6.3 Now, verify that Docker is up and running: system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;version&quot;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;Client:&quot; ## [2] &quot; Version: 18.06.1-ce&quot; ## [3] &quot; API version: 1.38&quot; ## [4] &quot; Go version: go1.10.3&quot; ## [5] &quot; Git commit: e68fc7a&quot; ## [6] &quot; Built: Tue Aug 21 17:21:31 2018&quot; ## [7] &quot; OS/Arch: darwin/amd64&quot; ## [8] &quot; Experimental: false&quot; ## [9] &quot;&quot; ## [10] &quot;Server:&quot; ## [11] &quot; Engine:&quot; ## [12] &quot; Version: 18.06.1-ce&quot; ## [13] &quot; API version: 1.38 (minimum version 1.12)&quot; ## [14] &quot; Go version: go1.10.3&quot; ## [15] &quot; Git commit: e68fc7a&quot; ## [16] &quot; Built: Tue Aug 21 17:29:02 2018&quot; ## [17] &quot; OS/Arch: linux/amd64&quot; ## [18] &quot; Experimental: true&quot; Remove the pet container if it exists (e.g., from a prior run) if (system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;ps -a&quot;, stdout = TRUE) %&gt;% grepl(x = ., pattern = &#39;postgres-dvdrental.+pet&#39;) %&gt;% any()) { system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;rm -f pet&quot;) } 6.4 Build the Docker Image Build an image that derives from postgres:10. Connect the local and Docker directories that need to be shared. Expose the standard Postgres port 5432. wd &lt;- getwd() docker_cmd &lt;- paste0( &quot;run -d --name pet --publish 5432:5432 &quot;, &#39;--mount &quot;type=bind,source=&#39;, wd, &#39;/,target=/petdir&quot;&#39;, &quot; postgres:10&quot; ) system2(&quot;docker&quot;, docker_cmd, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;b63443ed2c9efdbf6f03f83a836aed3094486eba710df9404809c62006c0cd14&quot; Peek inside the docker container and list the files in the petdir directory. Notice that dvdrental.tar is in both. system2(&#39;docker&#39;, &#39;exec pet ls petdir | grep &quot;dvdrental.tar&quot; &#39;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;dvdrental.tar&quot; dir(wd, pattern = &quot;dvdrental.tar&quot;) ## [1] &quot;dvdrental.tar&quot; We can execute programs inside the Docker container with the exec command. In this case we tell Docker to execute the psql program inside the pet container and pass it some commands. Sys.sleep(2) # inside Docker, execute the postgress SQL command-line program to create the dvdrental database: system2(&#39;docker&#39;, &#39;exec pet psql -U postgres -c &quot;CREATE DATABASE dvdrental;&quot;&#39;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;CREATE DATABASE&quot; The psql program repeats back to us what it has done, e.g., to create a databse named dvdrental. Next we execute a different program in the Docker container, pg_restore, and tell it where the restore file is located. If successful, the pg_restore just responds with a very laconic character(0). Sys.sleep(2) # restore the database from the .tar file system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;exec pet pg_restore -U postgres -d dvdrental petdir/dvdrental.tar&quot;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## character(0) file.remove(here(&quot;dvdrental.tar&quot;)) # the tar file is no longer needed. ## [1] TRUE Use the DBI package to connect to Postgres. But first, wait for Docker &amp; Postgres to come up before connecting. Sys.sleep(4) con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), host = &quot;localhost&quot;, port = &quot;5432&quot;, user = &quot;postgres&quot;, password = &quot;postgres&quot;, dbname = &quot;dvdrental&quot; ) # note that the dbname is specified dbListTables(con) ## [1] &quot;actor_info&quot; &quot;customer_list&quot; ## [3] &quot;film_list&quot; &quot;nicer_but_slower_film_list&quot; ## [5] &quot;sales_by_film_category&quot; &quot;staff&quot; ## [7] &quot;sales_by_store&quot; &quot;staff_list&quot; ## [9] &quot;category&quot; &quot;film_category&quot; ## [11] &quot;country&quot; &quot;actor&quot; ## [13] &quot;language&quot; &quot;inventory&quot; ## [15] &quot;payment&quot; &quot;rental&quot; ## [17] &quot;city&quot; &quot;store&quot; ## [19] &quot;film&quot; &quot;address&quot; ## [21] &quot;film_actor&quot; &quot;customer&quot; dbListFields(con, &quot;rental&quot;) ## [1] &quot;rental_id&quot; &quot;rental_date&quot; &quot;inventory_id&quot; &quot;customer_id&quot; ## [5] &quot;return_date&quot; &quot;staff_id&quot; &quot;last_update&quot; dbDisconnect(con) 6.5 Stop and start to demonstrate persistence Stop the container system2(&#39;docker&#39;, &#39;stop pet&#39;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;pet&quot; Restart the container and verify that the dvdrental tables are still there system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;start pet&quot;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;pet&quot; Sys.sleep(1) # need to wait for Docker &amp; Postgres to come up before connecting. con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), host = &quot;localhost&quot;, port = &quot;5432&quot;, user = &quot;postgres&quot;, password = &quot;postgres&quot;, dbname = &quot;dvdrental&quot; ) # note that the dbname is specified dbListTables(con) ## [1] &quot;actor_info&quot; &quot;customer_list&quot; ## [3] &quot;film_list&quot; &quot;nicer_but_slower_film_list&quot; ## [5] &quot;sales_by_film_category&quot; &quot;staff&quot; ## [7] &quot;sales_by_store&quot; &quot;staff_list&quot; ## [9] &quot;category&quot; &quot;film_category&quot; ## [11] &quot;country&quot; &quot;actor&quot; ## [13] &quot;language&quot; &quot;inventory&quot; ## [15] &quot;payment&quot; &quot;rental&quot; ## [17] &quot;city&quot; &quot;store&quot; ## [19] &quot;film&quot; &quot;address&quot; ## [21] &quot;film_actor&quot; &quot;customer&quot; Stop the container &amp; show that the container is still there, so can be started again. system2(&#39;docker&#39;, &#39;stop pet&#39;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;pet&quot; # show that the container still exists even though it&#39;s not running psout &lt;- system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;ps -a&quot;, stdout = TRUE) psout[grepl(x = psout, pattern = &#39;postgres-dvdrental.+pet&#39;)] ## character(0) But for the moment, let’s remove it. system2(&#39;docker&#39;, &#39;rm pet&#39;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;pet&quot; Next time, you can just use this command to start the container: system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;start pet&quot;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) And once stopped, the container can be removed with: system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;rm pet&quot;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) "],
