<!-- 
When vendors implement such changes, their QA team performs rigorous testing before releasing the new functionality to their client base.  Their clients' IT departments also test the new functionality in their own DEV/QA environments before promoting the new functionality into their production environments.

Sometimes the vendors application doesn't quite address a customers need or a new need arises say a new government regulation.  

*  Many database vendor applictions recognize that they cannot address of all their custommers requirements and build in special user defined columns.  The business can activate a column and use it to address some business need not designed into the application.

*  Sometimes business users will a column that doesn't make sense for their business and use it anyway to address a one time business need.  

3.  The business re-purposes a column in a table and the column definition changes.  Again there is a break in the meaning of the new columns between the existing records and new records.

The DVD rental database data is too clean to demonstrate some join concepts.  To dirty the data, this chapter performs a number of database operations on tables that a data analyst is typically restricted from doing.  

1.  Deleting records from tables.
2.  Inserting records from tables.
3.  Enabling and disabling table constraints.

In your Docker environment, you have all database privledges.

Verify Docker is up and running:

```r
sp_check_that_docker_is_up()
```

```
## [1] "Docker is up, running these containers:"                                                                                                      
## [2] "CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES"    
## [3] "aadf35d5b8b9        postgres-dvdrental   \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   About a minute ago   Up 3 seconds        0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   sql-pet"
```

Verify pet DB is available, it may be stopped.


```r
sp_show_all_docker_containers()
```

```
## CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES

```

Start up the `docker-pet` container


```r
sp_docker_start("sql-pet")
```

Now connect to the database with R


```r
# need to wait for Docker & Postgres to come up before connecting.

con <- sp_get_postgres_connection(
  user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
  dbname = "dvdrental",
  seconds_to_test = 30
)
```

# SQL Union Exercise

When joining many tables, it is helpful to have the number of rows from each table as an initial sanity check that the joins are returning a reasonable number of rows.

## 1.  How many rows are in each table?


```r
rs <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select *
                 from (      select 'actor' tbl_name,count(*) from actor 
                       union select 'category' tbl_name,count(*) from category
                       union select 'film' tbl_name,count(*) from film
                       union select 'film_actor' tbl_name,count(*) from film_actor
                       union select 'film_category' tbl_name,count(*) from film_category
                       union select 'language' tbl_name,count(*) from language
                       union select 'inventory' tbl_name,count(*) from inventory
                       union select 'rental' tbl_name,count(*) from rental
                       union select 'payment' tbl_name,count(*) from payment
                       union select 'staff' tbl_name,count(*) from staff
                       union select 'customer' tbl_name,count(*) from customer
                       union select 'address' tbl_name,count(*) from address
                       union select 'city' tbl_name,count(*) from city
                       union select 'country' tbl_name,count(*) from country
                       union select 'store' tbl_name,count(*) from store
                       ) counts
                  order by tbl_name
                 ;
                "

## Exercises

### 1. Where is the DVD Rental Business located?

To answer this question we look at the `store`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables to answer this question.


```r
store_locations_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select s.store_id
       ,a.address
       ,c.city
       ,a.district
       ,a.postal_code
       ,c2.country
       ,s.last_update
   from store s 
         join address a on s.address_id = a.address_id
         join city c on a.city_id = c.city_id
         join country c2 on c.country_id = c2.country_id
")
sp_print_df(store_locations_sql)
```

### 2. List Each Store and the Staff Contact Information?

To answer this question we look at the `store`, `staff`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables.


```r
store_employees_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select st.store_id
       ,s.first_name
       ,s.last_name
       ,s.email

       ,c.city
       ,a.district
       ,a.postal_code
       ,c2.country
   from store st left join staff s on st.manager_staff_id = s.staff_id 
         left join address a on s.address_id = a.address_id
         left join city c on a.city_id = c.city_id
         left join country c2 on c.country_id = c2.country_id
")
sp_print_df(store_employees_sql)
```

Our DVD Rental business is international and operates in three countries, Canada, Austraila, and the United States.  Each country has one store.  The stores in Canada and Austrailia have one employee each.  The store in the United States has no employees yet.

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.




### 3. How Many Active, Inactive, and Total Customers Does the DVD Rental Business Have?

To answer this question we look at the `customer` table.  In a previous chapter we observed that there are two columns, `activebool` and `active`.  We consider `active = 1` as active.


```r
customer_cnt_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"SELECT sum(case when active = 1 then 1 else 0 end) active
       ,sum(case when active = 0 then 1 else 0 end) inactive
       ,count(*) total
   from customer")

sp_print_df(customer_cnt_sql)
```

<!--html_preserve--><div id="htmlwidget-1c31470500af88819e41" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.



### 4. How Many and What Percent of Customers Are From Each Country?

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables. 


```r
customers_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select c.active,country.country,count(*) count
              ,round(100 * count(*) / sum(count(*)) over(),4) as pct
         from customer c
              join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
              join city  on a.city_id = city.city_id
              join country on city.country_id = country.country_id

Our DVD Rental business is international and operates in three countries, Canada, Austraila, and the United States.  Each country has one store.  Has this store recently been closed or not yet opened?  The third store has a current last_update column.  It may not have opened yet.

The stores in Canada and Austrailia have one employee each.  The store in the United States has no employees yet.  

The business has 604 customers. 

Based on the table above, the DVD Rental business has customers in 118 countries.  The DVD Rental business cannot have many walk in customers.  It must use a mail order distribution model.

### 5 What Countries Constitute the Top 25% of the Customer Base?

Using the previous code, we will add two new columns.  One column shows a running total and the second column shows a running percentage.

<!--
The SQL block uses a nested SQL block.  The inner block is the same SQL used in the previous SQL code block.

A subquery is a SELECT statement nested within another SELECT statement.  In the example below, the nested SQL block follows the `from` and enclosed in parenthesis.  The nested subquery is aliased as `ctry`.  The subquery returns intermediate results, country counts.

```
select ...
  from (select ... from ...  where )
 where ....  
```
-->

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables again.


```r
customers_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,

        select c.active,country.country,count(*) count

### 8.  What is the distribution of DVD's by Language 

To answer this question we look at the `language` and `film` tables.


```r

### 9.  What are the number of rentals and rented amount by store, by month?

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables to answer this question. 


```r

### 11 What is the rental distribution/DVD for the top two rented films?

From the previous exercise we know that the top two films are `Bucket Brotherhood` and `Rocketeer Mother`.  To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables again.  Instead of looking at the film level, we need to drill down to the individual dvd's for each film to answer this question.



```r
film_rank_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id,count(*) 
   from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
        join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id
  where i.film_id in (103,738)
group by i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id")

sp_print_df(film_rank_sql)
```

### 12.  Which film(s) have never been rented

To answer this question we look at the `film`, `inventory` and `rental` tables.


```r

### 20.  Which customers have never rented a movie?

To answer this question we look at the `customer` and `rental` tables.

<!--
Businesses spend a lot of time and money converting prospects to customers.  The manager would like you to generate a list of customers who have never rented a movie.

This type of question is what dplyr calls an anti-join.  SQL doesn't have a formal anti-join, but an anti-join can be implemented in multiple ways in SQL.  In this case, the anti-join returns customer rows from a left outer join from customer to the rental table with a null rental_id.  In the next three code blocks, we show three different ways to implement an Anti-Join

#### SQL ANTI JOIN -- Null Syntax 
-->


```r
customer_rental_anti_join_sql <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select c.customer_id id
         ,c.first_name
         ,c.last_name
         ,c.email
         ,a.phone
         ,city.city
         ,ctry.country
         ,c.active 
         ,c.create_date
--         ,c.last_update
     from customer c left join rental r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
                     left join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
                     left join city on a.city_id = city.city_id
                     left join country ctry on city.country_id = ctry.country_id

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

Use the dplyr inner_join verb to find the top 5 customers who have rented the most movies.



### 23 Combine the top 5 rental customers, (40 or more rentals), and zero rental customers

```r

  con,
  "select c.customer_id cust_id
         ,concat(c.first_name,' ',c.last_name) customer

### 24.  Top-n1 and bottom-n2 customers?

Parmeterize the previous exercise to show the top 5 and bottom 5 customers. 

<!--

The issue with the two previous reports is that the top end is hardcoded.  Over time, the current customers will always be in the top section and new customers will get added.  Another way of looking at the previous report is to show the top 5 and bottom 5 customers.  

The managers would like to send a special promotion to the top n1 customers and exclude the bottom n2 customer from any new promotions.

### Inline SQL Block Syntax

An Inline SQL Block is an inner SQL statement that acts like a table within an outer SQL select statement.  The inner SQL select statement is enclosed in parens, () and aliased, TBL1 and TBL2 in the following examples.  


```
Form 1:
SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT * FROM A,B,C ...) AS TBL1
      ,(SELECT * FROM X,Y,Z ...) AS TBL2
 WHERE TBL1.COL_E = TBL2.COL_E ... 

Form 2:
SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT
          FROM (SELECT *
                  FROM A,B,C ...          
               ) AS TBL1
       ) AS TBL2
```
-->


```r

    customer_rental_high_low_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,

           ,c(high_n,low_n)
        )
    return (customer_rental_high_low_sql)

```

The next code block executes a sql version of such a function.  With top_n = 5 and bot_n = 5, it replicates the hard coded version of the previous exercise. With top_n = 5 and bot_n = 0, it gives a top 5 report.  With top_n = 0 and bot_n = 5, the report returns the bottom 5.  Change the two parameters to see the output from the different combinations.


```r
top_n = 5
bot_n = 5
sp_print_df(customer_rentals_hi_low_sql(top_n,bot_n))

### SQL Rows Per Table 

In the examples above, we looked at how many rows were involved in each of the join examples and which side of the join they came from.  It is often helpful to know how many rows are in each table as a sanity check on the joins.  

Below is the SQL version to return all the row counts from each table in the DVD Rental System.


```r
rs <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select *
                 from (      select 'actor' tbl_name,count(*) from actor 
                       union select 'category' tbl_name,count(*) from category
                       union select 'film' tbl_name,count(*) from film
                       union select 'film_actor' tbl_name,count(*) from film_actor
                       union select 'film_category' tbl_name,count(*) from film_category

                       union select 'rental' tbl_name,count(*) from rental
                       union select 'payment' tbl_name,count(*) from payment
                       union select 'staff' tbl_name,count(*) from staff
                       union select 'customer' tbl_name,count(*) from customer

### SQL store revenue stream

How are the stores performing?  The SQL code shows the payments made to each store in the business.


```r

### SQL:Estimate Outstanding Balance

The following SQL code calculates for each store

1.  the number of payments still open and closed from the DVD Rental Stores customer base.
2.  the total amount that their customers have paid
3.  the average price per/movie based off of the movies that have been paid.
4.  the estimated outstanding balance based off the open unpaid rentals * the average price per paid movie.


```r
rs <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "SELECT s.store_id store,sum(CASE WHEN payment_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) open
    ,sum(CASE WHEN payment_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) paid
    ,sum(p.amount) paid_amt
    ,count(*) rentals
    ,round(sum(p.amount) / sum(CASE WHEN payment_id IS NOT NULL

#### Exercise Dplyr Modify the following dplyr code to match the SQL output from above.



### SQL actual outstanding balance

In the previous exercise, we estimated the outstanding amount.  After reviewing the rental table, the actual movie rental rate is in the table.  We use that to calculate the outstanding balance below.


```r
rs <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "SELECT sum(f.rental_rate) open_amt
    ,count(*) count
FROM rental r
LEFT JOIN payment p
    ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory i
    ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film f
    ON i.film_id = f.film_id
WHERE p.rental_id IS NULL
;"
)
sp_print_df(head(rs))
```

## Different strategies for interacting with the database


select examples
    dbGetQuery returns the entire result set as a data frame.  
        For large returned datasets, complex or inefficient SQL statements, this may take a 
        long time.

      dbSendQuery: parses, compiles, creates the optimized execution plan.  
          dbFetch: Execute optimzed execution plan and return the dataset.
    dbClearResult: remove pending query results from the database to your R environment

### Use dbGetQuery

How many customers are there in the DVD Rental System


```r
rs1 <- dbGetQuery(con, "select * from customer;")
sp_print_df(head(rs1))
```

### Active SQL Analysis

In this code block summarize the activebool and active value combinations as a count of the two values combinations, a percent, and a running total.


```r
active_sql <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select c.activebool
         ,c.active,count(*), round(100 * count(*)/sum(count(*)) over (),2) as pct
         ,sum(count(*)) over (order by activebool, active) running_total
     from customer c
   group by c.activebool,c.active
  "
)
sp_print_df(active_sql)
```

The `activebool` column only takes on a single value, `true`.  The `active` column takes on only two values, {0,1}.  

Dplyr order_by

```
Description

This function makes it possible to control the ordering of window functions in R that don't have a specific ordering parameter. When translated to SQL it will modify the order clause of the OVER function.

Usage

order_by(order_by, call)
Arguments

order_by	
a vector to order_by
call	
a function call to a window function, where the first argument is the vector being operated on
```

??? how to implement multi-column order by in example below???  If there were more than two combinations, I would like to see it ordered by all combinations


```r
customer_table <- DBI::dbReadTable(con, "customer")
active_dplyr <- customer_table %>% group_by(activebool,active) %>% 
    summarize(cnt=n()) %>% 
    mutate(running=order_by(active,cumsum(cnt))
          ,total=sum(cnt)
          ,pct=round(100 * cnt/total,2)
          ) %>%
select(-running)    
sp_print_df(active_dplyr)
```

### 12.  DVD rental distribution Running Totals.

In exercise 'What Countries Constitute the Top 25% of the Customer Base?' you had a running total and running percent for each country.  Use the preceding exercise and add a running total by film-dvd within a store, film-dvd across stores, and a running total for each dvd.  To make validation easy, restrict the query to the top two DVD rentals.


```r
film_rank_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
