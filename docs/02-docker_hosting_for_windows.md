# Docker Hosting for Windows (02)

At the end of this chapter, you will be able to

  * Setup your environment for Windows.
  * Use Git and GitHub effectively on Windows.


Skip these instructions if your computer has either OSX or a Unix variant.

## Hardware requirements
You will need an Intel or AMD processor with 64-bit hardware and the hardware virtualization feature. Most machines you buy today will have that, but older ones may not. You will need to go into the BIOS / firmware and enable the virtualization feature. You will need at least 4 gigabytes of RAM!

## Software requirements
You will need Windows 7 64-bit or later. If you can afford it, I highly recommend upgrading to Windows 10 Pro.

### Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 Home (64 bit)
Install Docker Toolbox. The instructions are here: <https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/>. Make sure you try the test cases and they work!

### Windows 10 Pro
Install Docker for Windows *stable*. The instructions are here: <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#start-docker-for-windows>. Again, make sure you try the test cases and they work.

## Additional technical details

See the Chapter on [Additional technical details for Windows users (95)] for more information.
