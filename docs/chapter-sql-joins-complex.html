<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Database Privileges</h2>
<p>In the DVD rental database, you have all database privileges to perform any CRUD operaion, create, read, update, and delete on any database object. As a data analyst, you typically only get select privilege which allows you to read only a subset of the tables in a database. Occasionally, a proof of concept project may have a sandbox spun up where users are granted additional priviledges.</p>
</div>
<div id="database-constraints" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Database constraints</h2>
<p>As a data analyst, you really do not need to worry about database constraints since you are primarily writing dplyr/SQL queries to pull data out of the database. Constraints can be enforced at multiple levels: column, table, multiple tables, or at the schema itself. The common database constraints are a column is <code>NOT NULL</code>, a column is <code>UNIQUE</code>, a column is a <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>, both <code>NOT NULL</code> and <code>UNIQUE</code>, or a column is a <code>FOREIGN KEY</code>, the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> on another table. Constraints restrict column values to a set of defined values and help enforce referential integrity between tables.</p>
<div id="dvd-rental-primary-foreign-key-constraints" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.2.1</span> DVD Rental Primary Foreign Key Constraints</h3>
<p>For this tutorial, we are primarily concerned with primary and foreign key relationships between tables in order to correctly join the data between tables. If one looks at all the tables in the DVD Rental ERD, add link here, the first column is the name of the table followed by &quot;_id“. This is the primary key on the table. In some of the tables, there are other columns that begin with the name of a different table, the foreign table, and end in”_id&quot;. These are foreign keys and the foreign key value is the primary key value on the foreign table. The DBA will index the primary and foreign key columns to speed up query performanace.</p>
<p>In the table below, all the primary foreign key relationships are shown because the DVD rental system is small. Real world databases typically have hundreds or thousands of primary foreign key relationships. In the search box, enter ‘PRIMARY’ or ‘FOREIGN’ to see the table primary key or the table’s foreign key relationships.</p>

<p>Searching for ‘FOREIGN’ in the table above, one sees that the <code>column_name</code> matches the <code>ref_table_col</code>. This is pretty typical, but not always the case. This can occur because of an inconsistent naming convention in the application design or a table contains multiple references to the same table foreign table and each reference indicates a different role. A non-DVD rental example of the latter is a patient transaction record that has a referring doctor and and performing doctor. The two columns will have different names, but may refer to the same or different doctors in the doctor table. In this case you may hear one say that the doctor table is performing two different roles.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.7</span> Joins</h2>
<p>In section ‘SQL Quick Start Simple Retrieval’, there is a brief discussion of databases and 3NF. One of the goals of normalization is to eliminate redundant data being kept in multiple tables and having each table contain a very granular level of detail. If a record then needs to be updated, it is updated in one table instead of multiple tables improving overall system performance. This also helps simplify and maintain referential integerity between tables.</p>
<p>Bill Kent famously summarized 3NF as every non-key column “must provide a fact about the key,the whole key, and nothing but the key, so help me Codd.”</p>
<p>Normalization breaks data down and JOINs denormalizes the data and builds it back up. The tables are typically related via a primary key - foreign key relationship. The PostgreSQL database enforces the primary and foreign key constraints in the DVD rental database.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.7.2</span> Valentines Party</h3>
<p>Imagine you are at a large costume Valentine’s Day dance party. The hostess of the party, a data scientist, would like to learn more about the people attending her party. When the band takes a break, she lets everyone know it is time for the judges to evaluate the winners for best costumes and associated prizes.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="screenshots/ValentinesDay.PNG" alt="ValentinesDay" />
<p class="caption">ValentinesDay</p>
</div>
<p>She requests the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>All the couples at the party line up in front of her in a single line with the men on her left and the women on her right, (inner join)</p></li>
<li><p>All the remaining men to form a second line two feet behind the married men, (left outer join, all couples + unattached men)</p></li>
<li><p>All the remaining women to form a third line two feet in front of the married women, (right outer join, all couples + unattached women)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As our data scientist looks out, she can clearly see the three distinct lines, the single men, the man woman couples, and the single women, a full outer join.</p>
<p>As the three judges start walking down the lines, she makes one more announcement.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There is a special prize for the man and woman who can guess the average age of the members of the opposite sex. To give everyone a chance to come up with an average age, she asks the men to stay in line and the women to move down the mens line in order circling back around until they get back to their starting point in line, (cartesian join, every man seen by every woman and vice versa).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is hard enough to tell someone’s age when they don’t have a mask, how do you get the average age when people have masks?</p>
<p>The hostess knows that there is usually some data anomolies. As she looks out she sees a small cluster of people who did not line up. Being the hostess with the mostest, she wants to get to know that small cluster better. Since they are far off and in costume, she cannot tell if they are men or women. More importantly, she does not know if they identify as a man or a woman, both – (kind of a stretch for a self join), neither, or something else. Ahh, the inquisitive mind wants to know.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.7.4</span> Join Tables</h3>
<p>The dplyr join documentation describes two different types of joins, <code>mutating</code> and <code>filtering</code> joins. For those coming to R with a SQL background, the mutating documentation is misleading in one respect. Here is the inner_join documentation.</p>
<pre><code>    inner_join()
    
    return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.</code></pre>
<p>The misleading part is that all the columns from <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. If the join column is <code>KEY</code>, SQL will return x.KEY and y.KEY. Dplyr retuns KEY. It appears that the KEY value comes from the driving table. This difference should become clear in the outer join examples.</p>
<p>In the next couple of examples, we will pull all the language and <code>film</code> table data from the database into memory because the tables are small. In the *_join verbs, the <code>by</code> and <code>suffix</code> parameters are included because it helps document the actual join and the source of join columns.</p>

<div id="natural-join-delayed-time-bomb-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.8</span> Natural Join Delayed Time Bomb</h2>
<p>The dplyr default join is a natural join, joining tables on common column names. One of many links why one should not use natural joins can be found <a href="http://gplivna.blogspot.com/2007/10/natural-joins-are-evil-motto-if-you.html">here</a>. If two tables are joined via a natural join on column <code>C1</code> the join continues to work as long as no additional common columns are added to either table. If a new new column <code>C2</code> is added to one of the tables and <code>C2</code> already exists in the other table, BOOM, the delayed time bomb goes off. The natural join still executes, doesn’t throw any errors, but the returned result set may be smaller, much smaller, than before the new <code>C2</code> column was added.<br />
