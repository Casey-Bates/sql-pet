# Create the dvdrental database in PostgreSQL in Docker {#chapter_setup-dvdrental-db}

> NOTE: This Chapter walks through the all steps needed to setup the dvdrental database in Docker.  All susequent chapters depend on this setup.  If for some reason you need to setup the Docker database but don't want to step through this *teaching version* of the setup, you can use:

> `source('book-src/setup-dvdrental-docker-container.R')`

> This chapter demonstrates how to:
>
>  * Setup the `dvdrental` database in Docker
>  * Stop and start Docker container to demonstrate persistence
>  * Connect to and disconnect R from the `dvdrental` database
>  * Set up the environment for subsequent chapters

## Overview

In the last chapter we connected to PostgreSQL from R.  Now we set up a "realistic" database named `dvdrental`. There are different approaches to doing this: this chapter sets it up in a way that doesn't show all the Docker details.

These packages are called in this Chapter:
```{r setup, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres)
library(glue)
require(knitr)
library(dbplyr)
library(sqlpetr)
library(bookdown)
```

## Verify that Docker is up and running
```{r docker verify}
sp_check_that_docker_is_up()
```

## Clean up if appropriate
Force-remove the `cattle` and `sql-pet` containers if they exist (e.g., from a prior runs):
```{r}
sp_docker_remove_container("cattle")
sp_docker_remove_container("sql-pet")
```
## Build the pet-sql Docker image
For the rest of the book we will be using a Docker image called
`postgres-dvdrental`. To save space here in the book, we've created a function
in `sqlpetr` to build this image, called [`sp_make_dvdrental_image`](https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr/reference/sp_make_dvdrental_image.html). Vignette [Building the `dvdrental` Docker Image
](https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr/articles/building-the-dvdrental-docker-image.html) describes the build process.

```{r}
sp_make_dvdrental_image("postgres-dvdrental")
```

Did it work? We have a function that lists the images into a tibble!
```{r}
sp_docker_images_tibble()

```

## Run the pet-sql Docker Image
Now we can run the image in a container and connect to the database. To run the
image we use an `sqlpetr` function called [`sp_pg_docker_run`](https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr/reference/sp_pg_docker_run.html)

```{r}
sp_pg_docker_run(
  container_name = "sql-pet",
  image_tag = "postgres-dvdrental",
  postgres_password = "postgres"
)
```

Did it work?
```{r}
sp_docker_containers_tibble()

```

## Connect to PostgreSQL with R

Use the DBI package to connect to the `dvdrental` database in PostgreSQL.  Remember the settings discussion about [keeping passwords hidden][Pause for some security considerations]

```{r }
con <- sp_get_postgres_connection(
  host = "localhost",
  port = 5432,
  user = "postgres",
  password = "postgres",
  dbname = "dvdrental",
  seconds_to_test = 30
)
```

List the tables in the database and the fields in one of those tables.  
```{r }
dbListTables(con)
```
```{r }
dbListFields(con, "rental")
```

Disconnect from the database:
```{r }
dbDisconnect(con)

```
## Stop and start to demonstrate persistence

Stop the container:
```{r}
sp_docker_stop("sql-pet")
sp_docker_containers_tibble()
```

When we stopped `sql-pet`, it no longer appeared in the tibble. But the
container is still there. `sp_docker_containers_tibble` by default only lists
the *running* containers. But we can use the `list_all` option and see it:

```{r}
sp_docker_containers_tibble(list_all = TRUE)
```


Restart the container and verify that the dvdrental tables are still there:
```{r}
sp_docker_start("sql-pet")
sp_docker_containers_tibble()
```
Connect to the `dvdrental` database in PostgreSQL:
```{r}
con <- sp_get_postgres_connection(
  host = "localhost",
  port = 5432,
  user = "postgres",
  password = "postgres",
  dbname = "dvdrental",
  seconds_to_test = 30
)
```

Check that you can still see the fields in the `rental` table:
```{r}
dbListFields(con, "rental")
```

## Cleaning up

Always have R disconnect from the database when you're done.
```{r}

dbDisconnect(con)

```

Stop the `sql-pet` container:
```{r}
sp_docker_stop("sql-pet")
```
Show that the container still exists even though it's not running

```{r}
sp_show_all_docker_containers()

```

Next time, you can just use this command to start the container: 

> `sp_docker_start("sql-pet")`

And once stopped, the container can be removed with:

> `sp_check_that_docker_is_up("sql-pet")`

## Using the `sql-pet` container in the rest of the book

After this point in the book, we assume that Docker is up and that we can always start up our *sql-pet database* with:

> `sp_docker_start("sql-pet")`
