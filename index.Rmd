## Using R to query a DBMS in your organization

* **Data characteristics**
  * Large data stores in organizations that are kept in SQL databases have specific access constraints and structural characteristics that can be challenging to an R user (*useR* in the jargon).  

* **Technology hurdles**
  * Handling large volumes of data and considering performance issues in a dbms environment require an understanding of what's happening in "the back end" (which is often out of view).
  * The interfaces (passwords, packages, etc.) and gaps between R and a back end database are hidden from public view as a matter of security.
  * Resources for diagnosing interface problem behind corporate walls may or may not address all the issues that R users face, so a **simulated** environment such as we offer here is can be an important learning resources.

* **Use cases**
  * R users frequently need to make sense of complex data structures and coding schemes to address incompletely formed questions: therefore informal exploratory data analysis has to be intuitive and fast. The technology details should not get in the way.
  * Sharing and discussing exploratory and diagnostic techniques of exploration and retrieval is best in public but is constrained by organizational requirements.
  * Data documentation is often incomplete and emphasizes operational characteristics rather than analytic ones.  A careful useR often needs to confirm the documentation on the fly and de-normalize data carefully.

We have found that postgreSQL in a Docker container solves many of the foregoing problems.

## Docker as a tool for UseRs

Noam Ross's "[Docker for the UseR](https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Docker-for-the-UseR_Noam-Ross.pdf)" [@Ross2018a] suggests that there are four distinct Docker use-cases for useRs.  

1. Make a fixed working environment for reproducible analysis
2. Access a service outside of R **(e.g., Postgres)**
3. Create an R based service (e.g., with `plumber`)
4. Send our compute jobs to the cloud with minimal reconfiguration or revision

This book explores #2 because it allows us to work on the database access issues described above and to practice on an industrial-scale DBMS.  

* Docker is a comparatively easy way to simulate the relationship between an R/RStudio session and a database -- all on on your machine (provided you have Docker installed and running). 
* Running PostgreSQL on a Docker container avoids OS or system dependencies or conflicts that cause confusion and limit reproducibility. 
* A Docker environment consumes relatively few resources.  Our sandbox does much less but only includes postgreSQL and sample data, so it takes up about 5% of the space taken up by the Vagrant environment that inspired this project. [@Makubuya2018]
* A simple Docker container such as the one used in our sandbox is easy to use and could be extended for other uses.
* Docker is a widely used technology for deploying applications in the cloud, so for many useRs it's worth mastering.

## How did this project come about?

We trace this book back to the [June 2, 2018 Cascadia R Conf](https://cascadiarconf.com/) where Aaron Makubuya gave [a presentation using Vagrant hosting](https://github.com/Cascadia-R/Using_R_With_Databases) [@Makubuya2018].  After that [John Smith](https://github.com/smithjd), [Ian Franz](https://github.com/ianfrantz), and [Sophie Yang](https://github.com/SophieMYang) had discussions after the monthly [Data Discussion Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Data-Science-Group/events/fxvhbnywmbgb/) about the difficulties around setting up Vagrant, (a virtual environment), connecting to a corporate database and having realistic **public** environment to demo or practice the issues that come up behind corporate firewalls. [Scott Came's](https://github.com/scottcame) tutorial on [R and Docker](http://www.cascadia-analytics.com/2018/07/21/docker-r-p1.html) [@Came2018] (an alternative to Vagrant) at the 2018 UseR Conference in Melbourne was provocative and it turned out he lived nearby.  We re-connected with [M. Edward (Ed) Borasky](https://github.com/znmeb) who had done extensive development for a [Hack Oregon data science containerization project](https://github.com/hackoregon/data-science-pet-containers) [@Borasky2018].
