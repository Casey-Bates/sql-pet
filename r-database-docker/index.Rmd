# Prerequisites
* R, and
* Docker hosting.

The database we use is PostgreSQL 10, but you do not need to install that - it's installed via a Docker image. RStudio 1.2 is highly recommended but not required.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
